# SignalHook

SignalHook is a developing python3 framework for exposing a discrete-time
signal to a custom processing or analyzing plugin. Currently, 'signal' means 
sampledata read from and written to file, although the goal is to eventually 
implement the same functionality for real-time data being read from and 
written to ring buffers. In its present, nascent form it only works for 8- 
and 16-bit PCM and 32- and 64-bit floating point .WAV audio files. Much more 
to come.
